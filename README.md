- Project Title: Movie Recommender System  
- Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Description:Developed a content-based Movie Recommender System that suggests similar movies based on genre, plot, cast, and director information. 
- The system uses text feature extraction and cosine similarity to find and rank similar movies. 
- It demonstrates practical applications of data preprocessing, vectorization, and similarity analysis.

Key Features:
- Loads and preprocesses movie metadata from a CSV file
- Combines multiple features (genre, overview, cast, etc.) into a unified text field
- Uses CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer to convert text to vectors
- Calculates similarity using cosine similarity
- Returns top N similar movies for a given movie input
- Learning Outcome:Gained hands-on experience with data wrangling, text processing, similarity computation, and building recommendation logic using Python and Pandas.
